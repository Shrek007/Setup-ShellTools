### File permissions
#   By default, file permissions are imported into WSL by some strange attempted conversion from 
# Windows ACL permissions (ex. NTFS Security Tab) to Unix based permissions (ex. 0765 or -rwxrw-r-x)

# To make WSL work smoother w/ permissions, it is recommended to enable metadata in WSL instances for unix style permissions
# Add to /etc/wsl.conf
[automount]
enabled = true
root = /mnt/
options = "metadata"

# NOTE***  creating files in bash on the mounted windows file system is ok, but once these files are opened in Windows
# It becomes somewhat likely that file permissions will revert to Windows ACL. This is because if a file is open and saved
# in windows, it needs to be overwritten... ie. the file is re-created but in windows.
# 
# For this reason, it is advised to work out of the WSL file directories as much as possible.
# 
# Side note: moving / copying files from the windows side to the linux side is enough to work around file permission
# errors, as Windows ACLs cannot exist (more accurately are completely ignored) in the Linux side as WSL 2 is actually a VM
