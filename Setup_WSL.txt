### File permissions
#   By default, file permissions are imported into WSL by some strange attempted conversion from 
# Windows ACL permissions (ex. NTFS Security Tab) to Unix based permissions (ex. 0765 or -rwxrw-r-x)

# To make WSL work smoother w/ permissions, it is recommended to enable metadata in WSL instances for unix style permissions
# Add to /etc/wsl.conf
